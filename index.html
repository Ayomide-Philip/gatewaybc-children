                <h2 class="text-center mt-4 pt-3" >The History of the Children Ministry</h2>
                <p class="lead">In the Scripture, the Assembly of Gods people compromised of adults(Men & Women), Youths and Children. Let take a look at the history of the children ministry.As it was recorded in Deuteronomy 31:11-12. </p>
                <p> The Church started in 1960 with the combination of adults and children worshipping together. This continued till 1966 when Ojesinas and others joined the church. Though there were some disadvantage in bringing adults and children together under the same roof for worship, learning the samethings, and even listing to the same lecture and Sermons; nevertheless, the disadvantages are more than the advantages.</p>
                <p>Early in the 1973, a building was erected for the children, and other workers joined them. The first building was erected on the Nigerian Railways land. In May, a final court verdict to demolish the erected building on the land was given. On 1st August 2009, the building was demolished and a new one was proposed to be built on the piece of land that the church acquired very near the main church auditorium.</p>
                <p>On 3rd August 2009, the new Children Church Foundation was laid. The following people took part in the Foundation laying service: <strong>Revd Dr. A.A. Alade, Revd E. Ade Adedeji,and Pastor (Mrs.) F.O. Adedeji, Pastor Ranti Amoo, Pastor J.A Adesope, Revd Dr. Olaniyan (The Baptist Conference Secretary of Oyo West), Mrs. Alao, Mr. Ogundeji, Juwon Adedeji, Precious Ayankeye and others.</strong> The building was completed to a stage and was dedicated temporarily for use October 26th by some members led by Revd Dr. A.A Alade before the celebration of the Goodness of God that took place that sunday.</p>
